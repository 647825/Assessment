        <em>Suriname</em> Get to know a touch of the Netherlands under the
        tropical sun during a tour in Suriname. Instead of one long route with
        overnight stays, you can make day trips in this country from your hotel
        in Paramaribo. From a city walk through the wooden capital to a trip
        with a dugout canoe on the Suriname River towards the Amazon region. One
        thing is certain: once on Surinamese soil you put the button in the no
        spang mode, in other words don't worry!
