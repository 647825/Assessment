        at TUI. The sun is shining and the sea is always within reach in this

        SPAIN A long coastline spread over several Costas, temperamental cities
        such as Barcelona and Madrid, the classic Andalusia in southern Spain
        and delicious tapas: if you can experience 'la buena vida' anywhere, it
        is during a holiday in Spain. Due to its location on the Mediterranean
        Sea, this country in southwestern Europe has been a favorite place for a
        flight or car holiday to Spain for years.

        Suriname Get to know a touch of the Netherlands under the tropical sun
        during a tour in Suriname. Instead of one long route with overnight
        stays, you can make day trips in this country from your hotel in
        Paramaribo. From a city walk through the wooden capital to a trip with a
        dugout canoe on the Suriname River towards the Amazon region. One thing
        is certain: once on Surinamese soil you put the button in the no spang
        mode, in other words don't worry!
