        <h5>Praag</h5>
        <p>
          The history of the Czech Republic is beautifully visible in the Czech
          capital Prague. The historic part of the city has been so well
          preserved that you can see buildings and style elements from many
          centuries back in the streets. It is not for nothing that Prague
          attracts millions of tourists every year, who are mainly drawn to the
          romance of the old town. Several nicknames are used to describe the
          uniqueness of Prague, such as “The Golden City” and “City of the
          Hundred Towers”. The fact is that the beauty of Prague is beyond
          question and you should see Prague at least once in your life.

        <h5>Rome</h5>
        <p>
          Rome is a fascinating mix of high culture, art, fashion and historic
          architecture. In the city with its mild Mediterranean climate, life
          lives on like one long uninterrupted theatrical performance. If you've
          ever wondered what la dolce vita means, you should take a vacation to
          Rome! And if the cobbled streets, beautiful architecture and romance
          make you long for more, don't forget to toss a coin in the Trevi
          Fountain. According to a legend, one day you will return to Rome.

        <h5>Madrid</h5>
        <p>
          A holiday in Madrid is a chic city with a rural idyll, cheerful chaos
          and a good dose of charm. The capital of Spain celebrates life full of
          vitality and has a contagious appetite for art, music and enjoyment of
          life. At first glance, Madrid (with 3.3 million inhabitants) has the
          allure of the capital of the Spanish kingdom, a position it has held
          since 1561. You will see beautiful palaces and buildings and elegant
          boulevards. The 21st century is emerging with a cosmopolitan and
          modern urban center with gleaming skyscrapers.
